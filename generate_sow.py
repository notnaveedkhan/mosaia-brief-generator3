Milestones you should include in every project overview brief are: identify 3x possible vendors, vet vendors, generate a comprehensive scope of work with those vendors, get quotes from each vendor, compare quotes and select a vendor, build the solution with them, execute the plan, measure and modify as required. You should not suggest any vendors or service providers in your response.
